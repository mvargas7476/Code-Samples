            <p class="myTextL">Mr. Vargas went to school at Louisiana State University in Shreveport achieving a Bachelors 
                              degree in Mathematics and Physics with emphasis in Mathematics and a Minor in Computer Science in 
                              2016. He is currently working on his Master's Degree at the University of Texas at Dallas. He has 
                              experience programming with Java, JavaScript, Python, iOS, HTML, CSS, and scratch. Mr. Vargas 
                              believes that learning how to use an engineering mindset to solve problems - of any type - is 
                              extremely useful. The ability to break down problems into smaller components is the way to 
                              complete any task. The journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.

            <p class="myTextC">I personally have been teaching for many years. It all began while I tutored Mathematics 
                              - Algebra II, Pre Calculus and Calculus - in high school. I then continued to tutor through
                              college. While in college I also began to teach martial arts. This is trully 
                              what showed me the joys of teaching. Then I started teaching in a school district, it all began here at West in 2017. 
                              My first year, I was teaching the Algebra I and 8th grade robotics. From then on, I continued to teach Mathematics while overseeing
                              the growth of the Robotics Magnet. I currently teach the entirety of the robotics Magnet, and always
                              look for ways to improve and better my program. In 2020 I was awarded the TI STEM award for the use 
                              of technology in our classroom.
