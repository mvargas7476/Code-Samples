# chat_app

This application is a chat screen leveraging a database in Firebase. The main idea is to use Firebase to not only send messages 
but also authenticate and login to the application. It is all set up in sucha a way that things are set up through Firebase. 
There is definitely a use case for this but here I just wanted to teach myself how to connect separate SDKs in an easy set up.
