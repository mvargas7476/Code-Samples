# iOS Folder

This folder contains all of the different apps I have developed while teaching myself how to use Xcode. Each Project has its own ReadME file so that s small explanation of what the app does can be give. The folders in here are set up in progressing order of what I learned. I have labeled them in the order in which I created the Apps. Again, this has been my personal project and a way to grow as a programmer.

I did mention about apps that I want to create for my personal use, besides the ones I have already created. Here are the apps I will be creating:

1.  A random timing trainer - for many years I practiced martial arts and I always wanted to improve my timing. However, if you are training alone this canâ€™t really be done. You always have to make the decision of when to punch/kick or act really. Therefore I would like to have an application that makes a sound at random intervals between 5-15 seconds and that you have to react to the sound for a certain amount of time. That way one could practice their timing alone.

2. School Calendar and Application - Currently the school at which I work, does not have an application. I want to create an app that does the following 3 things starting out. 1) display the school calendar for parents to be able to know what events are coming up that week/month/year. 2) Have a link embedded so that parents, students, or teachers can access the link used by our district to check grades of students. 3) Be able to add/save the events that you want from the school calendar so that parents can be reminded of the events prior to the day. 

For project 2 above, I know that I listed things in a very weird order. But that is the order of priority that I have for the things I want my application to do. I am currently half way through step 1 and done with step 2. Step 3 will come hopefully after I launch my app as part of an update. Currently I am trying to get better at MVC Application Design Pattern, so that I can hopefully re-use the code I write in other schools around our district

That concludes my iOS Readme File, hopefully you can see the apps and get to enjoy them. 

Thank you for your time
