# Python Projects

Machine learning models, data analysis pipelines, and low-level programming puzzles. Projects range from implementing ML algorithms from scratch to comparing them against scikit-learn, plus solving byte-manipulation challenges.

## Projects

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Linear Regression | Manual implementation of linear regression compared against scikit-learn — outputs prediction error |
| Neural Networks | Neural network built from scratch to predict outcomes and measure accuracy |
| K-Clusters | K-means clustering and image quantization using scikit-learn |
| Database Fill | Script to populate a database with generated data |
| Toms Data Onion | Solutions to a multi-layer low-level programming puzzle involving bit/byte manipulation, ASCII encoding, and networking protocols |
