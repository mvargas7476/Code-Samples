# Flutter Folder

In this folder I am adding the projects while I am teaching myself how to program using dart and the flutter framework to develop applications. I have a couple of applications that I really would like to develop but I am learning the basics first.

The folder is laid out in the order in which I did certain projects and wanted to learn. with 01_roll_app being the first app 
and the 07_chat_app being the last. I have used this to learn dart and the flutter framework so that I can officially create an 
original application of my own.

Hope you enjoy
