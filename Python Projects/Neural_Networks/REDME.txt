Link to the Tic-Tac-Toe Data set used: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tic-Tac-Toe+Endgame

Running the code:
1. run the following script: pip install -r requirements.txt to install the following libraries
    Pandas
    Numpy
    Scikit

2. Then, run the code normally. The data is downloaded and separated into train and test. The train dataset will train the algorithm 
to get the best weights for the predict function to make a prediction based on the test data

Table Summary
    The table is set up based on the training set results. It shows the error in the code, the activation function, the learning rate, and the number of iterations
the program ran. The table is self explanatory about how it should be interpreted.
