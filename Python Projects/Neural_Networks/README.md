# Creating Virtual Environment
Here are the steps that are needed to run the project in a terminal with BASH:
    1. python3 -m venv nerualNetwork
    2. source nerualNetwork/bin/activate
        - This will create a virtual environment to install all the requirements
    3. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    4. run the NN_Main.py script



# Table Summary
The table is set up based on the training set results. It shows the error in the code, the activation function, the learning rate, and the number of iterations the program ran. The table is self explanatory about how it should be interpreted.
