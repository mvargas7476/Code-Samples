## [ Layer 0/6: ASCII85 ]

ASCII85 is a binary-to-text encoding. These encodings are
useful when you need to send arbitrary binary data as text,
such as sending an image as an email attachment, or
embedding obfuscated data in a text file. It takes four
bytes of binary data, and converts them into five printable
ASCII characters. The encoding only uses 85 "safe" ASCII
characters, hence its name.

This payload has been encoded with Adobe-flavoured ASCII85.
All subsequent layers are ASCII85 encoded just like this
one, but they require additional processing in order to be
solved.
