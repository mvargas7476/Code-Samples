Description of  for Sklearn logs:
This folder also contains the text files created that log the attempts on the data and the results that I obtained. Its worth to mention that the weight values of the project was returned as an array and parsed into a String. This creates a confusing layout for the log. One that luckily it is not impossible to read. It is easier to search for the number of iterations to understand where each new line begins
