# Python Folder

This folder contains some of the Machine Learning projects that I have created. I practiced using scikit library. However, I did program some of the Machine Learning processes myself. I programmed a Linear Regression algorithm, and compared it to the scikit linear regression algorithm. 

I also created a Neural Network myself, and used it to calculate the error of prediction based on the data given. Both of these projects print the error of accuracy to which they are predicting results. Lastly, I used scikit learn to learn about k clustering and picture quantization. 

I have now also added the Tom's Data Onion puzzle solutions. Most of these puzzles work on very low level computations, using a lot of bit and bytes manipulations. 

Each folder contains a README.txt file that will explain how to run the program and discusses the results. In the case of Tom's Onion, the readme explains the layers of the puzzle and how I found out about the puzzle.

Hope you enjoy
