# Python Folder

This folder contains some of the Machine Learning projects that I have created. I practiced using scikit library. However, I did program some of the Machine Learning processes myself. I programmed a Linear Regression algorithm, and compared it to the scikit linear regression algorithm. 

I also created a Neural Network myself, and used it to calculate the error of prediction based on the data given. Both of these projects print the error of accuracy to which they are predicting results. Lastly, I used scikit learn to learn about k clustering and picture quantization. 

Each file contains a README.txt file that will explain how to run the program and discusses the results

Hope you enjoy
