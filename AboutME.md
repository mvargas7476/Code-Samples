# Information about Me
Currently I software developer. I have experience as a full stack developer with database, backend and frontend experience. Before being a software developer I was a Robotics and Programming teacher at a Junior High in the DFW area. Where I learned how much I enjoyed programming, and so I decided to make a career change out of education. I already knew programming because I had learned the basics from a minor I made while in college. 

I love my career change and programming. I am happy I made the switch
