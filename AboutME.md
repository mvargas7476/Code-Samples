# Information about Me

Currently I work as a Robotics and Coding teacher. But I am looking for something new, exciting and challenging. 
In college I learned how to code Java, and have always found it fascinating. Recently I decided that I wanted to learn 
more coding languages and how to use them. I have also always wanted to create a few apps that I could use 
for personal use - I will detail some of the apps I wanted to create inside the iOS Folder. 
Therefore I decided to teach myself how to code on Xcode. I am not saying that iOS is better or anything,
I just prefer to master one thing first before I learn how to code on Android - which is also something I would like 
to learn how to do. 

Currently I know how to code on Python and on Java. I have added some projects of works that 
I have done in Java, in my classes - this will be inside its own folder. As for my python projects this is the language 
I use to teach my students about how to code.  I do definitely enjoy coding and teaching myself how to create apps has 
been a very exhilarating process.

That concludes my AboutME File

Thank you for your time
