# Information about Me
Currently I am software developer. I have experience as a full stack developer with database, backend, and frontend experience. Before being a software developer I was a Robotics and Programming teacher at a Junior High in the DFW area. It is while teaching, that I learned how much I enjoyed programming, and so I decided to make a career change out of education. It was a somewhat easier transition since I got a Minor in Software Development. While transitioning out of education, I pursued and received my Masters on Software Engineering

Thank you for your time
